================================================================================
                        SELENIUM IMPLEMENTATION TIPS
================================================================================

1. Page Object Model (POM):
   - Create separate classes for each page (LoginPage, JobsPage, ProfilePage, etc.)
   - Store locators in one place
   - Reusable methods for common actions

2. Test Data Management:
   - Use external files (Excel, CSV, JSON) for test data
   - Separate test data from test scripts
   - Use unique emails with timestamps for registration tests

3. Wait Strategies:
   - Use explicit waits (WebDriverWait) instead of Thread.sleep()
   - Wait for elements to be clickable/visible before interaction
   - Handle dynamic content loading

4. Assertions:
   - Verify page titles, URLs, element visibility
   - Check success/error messages
   - Validate data in tables/lists

5. Screenshots:
   - Capture screenshots on test failure
   - Save with timestamp and test name
   - Useful for debugging

6. Test Reports:
   - Use TestNG or JUnit for test execution
   - Generate HTML reports
   - Include screenshots in reports

7. Common Locators to Use:
   - ID: Best choice when available
   - CSS Selector: Fast and reliable
   - XPath: Use when ID/CSS not available
   - Link Text: For navigation links

8. Handling Dynamic Elements:
   - Use relative XPath or CSS selectors
   - Wait for elements to load
   - Handle AJAX calls properly
